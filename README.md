Exersize app that will allow users to battle against a dungeon and dragons' character for workout motivation.
The user will pick their workout ahead of time from a slider of characters and will have special challenges along the way that they will check off at the end of their workout if they accomplish tehm. The user will get a status update of how they stack up against the monster and a prompt to come back again the next day. Having a monster to battle against will motivate people to workout more. Geared towards people that like video games.

We will be using the dungeons and dragons api for our monsters to battle against for your fitness

 -17 year old male
  yes I excersize pretty much everyday.
  I use an apple watch. I like it because I can set a daily goal and then it tells me what calories I burned  and what I accomplished that day.
  I am self motivated because of swim team and need to be in shape but more likely to meet a goal that was set that day (in morning) if remember to set one.
  Don't really interact with app just look at the end of the day for stats
  I Would be open to trying an app that has an avatar and interact with it... but don't want to interact too much. Only once a day.
  I don't really play video games.. I have played sweatcoin. You start walking and the app tracks how long you walk and rewards you with coins that use can use to get free stuff like socks or gift cards. I like that you don't need to interact with it. It just does it's thing and you get coins. 
  I would like to get rewards. 

  -32 year old female
  yes I workout a few times a week.
  I use a fit bit tracker connected to my phone.. it measures my movement and can look at phone later to get the statistics.
  Wouldn't want to interract with my phone during workouts. Like the idea of picking workout ahead of time.
  Self motivated but like the idea of the more you do your workout the stronger you get and the stronger your avatar gets.
  Does not play video games.
  I feel open to using technology in my workout but prefer to use it before and after for motivation and feed back not during.

  -24 year old male
  I don't workout enough. I would like too.
  I have used fitbit to track my walks.
  I like getting a map of where I walked and how many calories burned/ heart rate etc.
  Nothing I don't like just don't use it enough.
  I play madden and xbox league of legends.
  I'm not all that motivated to workout. I would be motivated by an app that has somekind of reward or scheduler to remind me.
  I would play against a monster but wouldn't want to stop in the middle to hit a button.
  I like seeing statistics.
