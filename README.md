ELEVATOR PITCH
****************************************************************************

Exercise app that will allow users to battle against a dungeon and dragons' character for workout motivation. The user will pick their work out ahead of time from a slider of characters and will have special challenges along the way that they will check off at the end of their workout if they accomplish them. The user will get a status update of how they stack up against the monster and a prompt to come back again the next day. Having a monster to battle against will motivate people to work out more. Geared towards people that like video games.

We will be using the dungeons and dragons api for our monsters to battle against for your fitness

 -17-year-old male
  yes, I exercise pretty much every day.
  I use an apple watch. I like it because I can set a daily goal and then it tells me what calories I burned and what I accomplished that day.
  I am self-motivated because of swim team and need to be in shape but more likely to meet a goal that was set that day (in morning) if I remember to set one.
  Don't really interact with app just look at the end of the day for stats.
  I Would be open to trying an app that has an avatar and interact with it... but don't want to interact too much. Only once a day.
  I don't really play video games.. I have played sweatcoin. You start walking and the app tracks how long you walk and rewards you with coins that use can use to get free stuff like socks or gift cards. I like that you don't need to interact with it. It just does its thing and you get coins. 
  I would like to get rewards. 

  -32-year-old female
  yes, I work out a few times a week.
  I use a fit bit tracker connected to my phone.. it measures my movement and can look at phone later to get the statistics.
  Wouldn't want to interact with my phone during workouts. Like the idea of picking workout ahead of time.
  Self-motivated but like the idea of the more you do your workout the stronger you get and the stronger your avatar gets.
  Does not play video games.
  I feel open to using technology in my workout but prefer to use it before and after for motivation and feedback not during.

  -24-year-old male
  I don't workout enough. I would like too.
  I have used fitbit to track my walks.
  I like getting a map of where I walked and how many calories burned/ heart rate etc.
  Nothing I don't like just don't use it enough.
  I play madden and Xbox league of legends.
  I'm not all that motivated to workout. I would be motivated by an app that has some kind of reward or scheduler to remind me.
  I think it would be fun to battle against a monster for my workout. I would try that.
  I like seeing statistics.
